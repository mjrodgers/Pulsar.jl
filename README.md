# Pulsar

I'm attempting to bring Juno to the Pulsar-edit, currently a work-in-progress.


# Atom

**Attention**: We have decided to join forces with the [Julia extension for VSCode](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode). As such, this Atom-based plugin is effectively in “maintenance-only mode” and we expect to only work on bug fixes in the future.

This is the language server backend for [Juno](http://junolab.org/), the [Julia](http://julialang.org/) IDE.

The frontend for certain exposed functionality (getting input, showing a selector widget etc.) is provided via [Juno.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/Juno.jl), which is a much more lightweight (and pure Julia) dependency.

For documentation on how the communication between client and server is handled, head on over to the [developer documentation at atom-julia-client](https://github.com/JunoLab/atom-julia-client/blob/master/docs/communication.md).


## Note for developers

If any method signature has been added/changed after you modify the code base,
it's better to add test cases against it and then update [the precompilation file](./src/precompile.jl)
using [SnoopCompile.jl](https://github.com/timholy/SnoopCompile.jl) against the test script,
so that we can obtain better first time invocation of those methods.

To update the precompilation file, you just need to run the following command:

> at the root of this package directory

```bash
λ julia --project=. --color=yes scripts/generate_precompile.jl
```
